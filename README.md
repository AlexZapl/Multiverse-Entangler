# Multiverse-Entangler
My little game. This little game is being created for graduation from school. I will be happy to receive your hints on the game.

## Game idea: 
Your friends have abandoned you and you have befriended moonsters. You must escape from this world. 
As soon as you escape to another 2nd world, you find yourself in the middle of the ocean on an island with a portal from which you came out. 
You must build your world here. ± in 30 minutes after entering the new world, your old friends will invade and try to take over your world. 
You need to defeat the enemies and return to the first world where everyone is against you. You kill them anddddd…

That’s all for now!
